  why_this_app: Your to-do list should be yours, forever. Most productivity apps are run by companies that can shut down, lose your data, or change their service. TaskPad is different. It runs 100% on the Internet Computer blockchain, making it a permanent, unstoppable public utility. Your task list is stored securely on-chain, always available, and can never be taken away from you. It's the last to-do list you'll ever need.
  key_features:
    - "Truly Permanent: Your tasks are stored on the blockchain and can never be lost or deleted by a third party."
    - "Always Available: Runs on a decentralized network, immune to company shutdowns or server outages."
    - "Simple & Fast: A clean, intuitive interface for managing your daily tasks without the clutter."
    - "Verifiably Secure: Because it's on-chain, your data is private and can't be tampered with."
    - "Agent-Ready API: A simple MCP interface for programmatic task management by AI agents or other smart contracts."
